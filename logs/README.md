# Logs Directory

This directory stores log files generated by the application. The logs are named with the following formats:

1. `arxiv_rss_bot_YYYYMMDD.log`: Main application logs with detailed information about the execution process.
2. `YYYYMMDD.log`: Additional logs that may be generated by specific components.

Logs are rotated daily, with each day's activities stored in a separate file.

These logs contain information about:
- Paper fetching operations
- Filtering results
- RSS feed generation
- Email subscription activities
- Errors and warnings

Log files may be useful for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
